The first three Os in the name `GoooQo` stands for the three major object concepts in the OSM technique:

- `Entity Object` is used to map the static part in the DML/DQL, such as table name and column names;
- `Query Object` is used to map the dynamic part in the DML/DQL, such as filter conditions, pagination, and sorting;
- `View Object` is used to map the static part in the DQL, such as table name, column names, nested views, and group-by columns.

Among them, `Qo` represents `Query Object`, which is the core object concept in the OSM technique.


    This is currently an experimental project and is not suitable for use in a production environment..
